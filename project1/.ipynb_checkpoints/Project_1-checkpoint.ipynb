    "## I. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to perform analysis of a network data set which contains information about owners of hamsters and the friendships between the owners. The owners maintain the details about their  hamster(s) on a website, and the owners also maintain friendship with some of the owners on the same website. This data has a lot of potential to study relationships between people based on various attributes of hamsters they own. For instance we can identify if the gender of hamster has any relationship to the number of friends a owner can have. We can also identify if the owner of same species of hamster tend to make more friends with similar species' owners than with the owners of different species. The data for this project is present as a compressed folder at http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/petster-hamster. The compressed file has 4 files described below: \n",
    "\n",
    "   * **ent.petster-hamster** - Contains hamster attributes such as ID, name, date joined, color,species, gender, birthday, age, hometown, favorite toy, favorite activity, favorite food.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * **out.petster-hamster** - Contains mapping between IDs, representing friendship between the owners of the hamsters with respective IDs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * **README.petster-hamster** - Information about the files and citation requirements\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * **meta.petster-hamster** - Contains information about the data\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will use the files **ent.petster-hamster** and **out.petster-hamster** data sets. Specifically we want to identify if the gender of the hamster has any effect on the centrality measures of the graph. We will use degree centrality, betweenness centrality and eigen vector centrality measures for this project. The requirements of this project are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build an undirected graph using the data present in *out.petster-hamster* data set. Each node will represent the hamster and each edge represents friendship between the owners of the hamster.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extract the gender of the hamster from *ent.petster-hamster*, and update each node of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Get the degree centrality and eigen vector centrality measures of each nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Perform hypothesis testing of the following hypothesis. A confidence level of 95% should be used in these tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "    _Hypothesis:1_\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $H_0:$ The Degree Centrality has a uniform effect, irrespective of the gender of the hamster\n",
    "\n",
    "    $H_1:$ The Degree Centrality has some effect based on the gender of the hamster\n",
    "\n",
    "    _Hypothesis:2_\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $H_0:$ The Eigen vector Centrality has a uniform effect, irrespective of the gender of the hamster\n",
    "\n",
    "    $H_1:$ The Eigen vector Centrality has some effect based on the gender of the hamster\n",
    "\n",
    "    _Hypothesis:3_\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $H_0:$ The Betweenness Centrality has a uniform effect, irrespective of the gender of the hamster\n",
    "\n",
    "    $H_1:$ The Betweenness Centrality has some effect based on the gender of the hamster\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If we identify that there is a relationship between the gender and the centrality measure(s), then identify which gender dominates the higher centrality measure(s)"

The starting quote of field-1 and the end quote of the last field also must be dropped, before creating a pandas data frame. However we are interested only in the gender and ent fields. The ent field helps us to uniquely identify a hamster, and the gender column will contain the gender of the hamster.
